/* ============================================================
   NEO CORE 3.0 — CONTENT STYLESHEET
   Perception Layer • Client-Side Only • Zero UI Intrusion
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   This file intentionally contains NO symbols, NO markers,
   NO pseudo-elements, and NO decorative overlays.

   All visual elements related to the veil must be created and
   governed solely by content.js. CSS must NEVER introduce any
   UI artifacts, icons, or markers on its own.

   Purpose:
     - Maintain a clean, interference-free environment.
     - Ensure comments remain visually consistent.
     - Guarantee the NEO veil leaves no trace when revealed.
     - Prevent accidental UI symbols from persisting.
   ============================================================ */


/* ------------------------------------------------------------
   GLOBAL SAFETY NOTE
   
   If you need to add styles later (blur, subtle background, 
   animation, etc.), they must be explicitly approved and 
   documented in NEO CORE governance files.

   For now, this file remains intentionally empty.
